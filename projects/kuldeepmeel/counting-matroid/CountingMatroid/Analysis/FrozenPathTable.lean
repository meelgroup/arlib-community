/-! The frozen BFS table certificate, before the final sink selection.
First discovery and bounded-distance completeness establish simple, globally
shortest recorded source walks. Thus the representation cap discards no vertex. -/

/-- INTERNAL: After the frozen layers, every recorded path is a simple source
walk at its indexed endpoint, and every source walk of at most `n` vertices
has a recorded path no longer than it.

* recovery · proved · strengthened the layer invariant with global minimality and bounded-distance completeness; source-walk suffixes exclude repeated endpoints and make the predecessor cap harmless.

* recovery · open · proved initial entry soundness; the layer induction needs first-discovery depth, simplicity, and bounded-distance completeness to justify predecessor truncation.
