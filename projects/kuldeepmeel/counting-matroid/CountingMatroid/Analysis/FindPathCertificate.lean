/-! Algorithmic half of successful augmentation, independent of matroid axioms.
The frozen BFS table certificate supplies valid simple source walks and
bounded-distance optimality. The final sink fold preserves validity and
selects a globally shortest source-to-sink walk. Both list caps are harmless. -/

/-- INTERNAL: The concrete frozen-layer search returns a shortest simple
source-to-sink reverse walk, so neither list cap discards a vertex.

Newest first. History, not instruction — what this file claims is above.

* recovery · proved · used FrozenPathTable.frozen_paths_certificate and proved sink-fold soundness and minimum selection; all four shortest-certificate fields are closed.

* recovery · partial · proved final sink-fold length bound even for arbitrary path tables; source-to-sink validity, simplicity and global minimality remain.

* recovery · open · exposed both folds; the bounded-distance frozen-table invariant and final minimum-sink selection remain.
