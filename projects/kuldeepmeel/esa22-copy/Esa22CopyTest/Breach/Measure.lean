# Planted breach: supplying your own measure

`opUpdate` is computable and takes the measure as an argument, so nothing the
compiler checks objects to a measure that reports nothing — this is
`Charged.exchange (fun _ => 0)` for space.  A program calls `Roster.insert`,
which passes a measure private to `Roster`.

`#programSeal` accepts only the canonical namespace `Esa22Copy.Program`, and
Lean cannot remove a constant once declared, so each planted breach lives in its
own module: here the cheat is the *only* declaration under `Esa22Copy.Program`,
and the expected message is a single entry that does not depend on any other
test.  This module is never imported alongside `Esa22Copy.Model.Program`.

A program that reads a dictionary without a charged operation, or that is marked noncomputable, can perform work it does not pay for.
